# Apache Logging Services Jenkins Pipelines

This repository is a centralized collection of [Jenkins pipelines](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) used in the [Apache Logging Services](https://logging.apache.org/) project.
These pipelines are located on [ci-builds.apache.org](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Logging/).

This repository is also a shared library configured as `@Library('logging')` or `lib 'logging'` in pipelines.
